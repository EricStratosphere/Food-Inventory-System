## 📌 **Usage**  

Follow these steps to effectively manage your food inventory and reduce waste:  

### 1️⃣ Open the Application  
Launch the application and navigate to the **inventory dashboard**, where you can view a comprehensive list of all stored food items categorized by **food type** and **storage location** (e.g., fridge, freezer, pantry).  

### 2️⃣ Manage Your Inventory  
Easily **add new food items** by providing key details such as:  
   - **Item name** (e.g., "Milk," "Apples," "Chicken Breast")  
   - **Quantity** (e.g., "2 liters," "5 pieces," "1 kg")  
   - **Category** (e.g., Dairy, Fruits, Vegetables, Meat & Poultry)  
   - **Storage location** (where the item is stored)  
   - **Expiration date** (to enable tracking)  

Once entered, the item will be stored in the database and displayed in your inventory dashboard.  

### 3️⃣ Edit or Delete Items  
Modify existing food items when necessary:  
   - **Edit items** if you consume part of an item, change storage location, or update any details.  
   - **Delete items** once they are fully consumed or discarded to keep your inventory up to date.  

### 4️⃣ Enter Your Email Address  
To receive timely expiration notifications, provide a **valid email address** in the application settings. This ensures that you stay informed about items that are approaching expiration.  

### 5️⃣ Get Notified and Take Action  
The system automatically tracks expiration dates and sends **reminders** when items are **Expiring Soon** or have already **Expired**. Upon receiving a notification:  
   - **Prioritize consuming items that are nearing expiration** to minimize waste.
